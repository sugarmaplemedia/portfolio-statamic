        text: 'Kath, Director of Communications at FFN and one of my contacts for the [Top of the Lake project](/portfolio/top-of-the-lake), contracted me to transfer content from their old WordPress website to their newly designed website (still WordPress), hosted elsewhere by the company providing the design. Over the course of forty-some hours, I moved over a hundred pages, nearly a thousand paragraphs, and many, many images. Some months later, she reeled me back in to build out the page layouts and SEO, and set up a new digital workspace for the organization.'

        text: "Despite both websites being built on top of WordPress, transferring the content was anything but simple. The old website was very text- and inline image-heavy, and was formatted with a mixture of out-of-date plugins and the original WP page builder. The new website utilized the WP Team's Gutenberg engine for page building, but Gutenberg is does not play well with dumping a bunch of text and images into its pages."
